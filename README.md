# Illumination

Illumination is a powerful yet minimal macOS menu bar utility designed to unlock the full brightness potential of Apple XDR and other EDR-capable displays. It intelligently extends the SDR brightness range while respecting HDR content and adapting to your environment.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental project
>
> Expect rough edges, broken promises and ruined displays. Use at your own risk. If you need a production-ready tool, consider established alternatives. Some noteworthy ones are listed below.

## Features

- Auto-Detection of EDR capable displays. ‚ö†Ô∏è Only Built-In at the moment ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Seamless System Integration: Works with macOS auto-brightness **ON**. Illumination only moves your brightness **while EDR is ON** and restores your pre‚ÄëEDR SDR level when EDR turns **OFF**.
-   **Calibrated Ambient Light Engine:**  
    Converts macOS‚Äôs raw `AmbientBrightness` (fixed‚Äëpoint, driver‚Äëinternal) into **real‚Äëworld lux** with a power law (L = a¬∑x^p), a **sun‚Äëanchor** at ~120¬†klx, and a gated **day‚Äëmax blend** for robustness. It‚Äôs stable from dim rooms to direct sun. 

    The complete methodology is detailed in our [**technical paper**](assets/Algorithm.pdf).
- Extended Dynamic Range (EDR): Go beyond the standard SDR brightness limits.
- Ambient Light Sensing (ALS): Automatically toggles EDR and **scales headroom** based on ambient light. Profiles are tuned for **daylight** (e.g., shade ‚Üí sun) with hysteresis to avoid cloud‚Äëflicker: Twilight, Daybreak, Midday (default), Sunburst, High Noon.
- HDR-Aware Ducking: A standout feature that automatically reduces the brightness boost when HDR content is detected. This preserves the creative intent of HDR media without requiring manual intervention. ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially working ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Persistent HDR Tile: An optional, small video tile that can be placed in a corner of the screen to ensure EDR mode remains active, keeping EDR engaged within fullscreen applications/spaces.
- Debug submenu with extended diagnostics and fine-grained control settings.

### Known limits
- Lux is capped at **120¬†000** to match observed ALS saturation.
- EDR can draw significant power at high nits.
- Built‚Äëin displays only (for now).

## Getting Started: Building from Source

This project uses a `Makefile` to automate the build process.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode (26+ recommended) installed.
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/peterneutron/illumination.git
  ```

#### 2. One-Time Setup in Xcode

Before you can build from the command line, you need to configure code signing once in Xcode.

1.  Open `Illumination.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2.  In the project navigator, select the "Illumination" project, then the "Illumination" target.
3.  Go to the **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab.
4.  From the **"Team"** dropdown, select your personal Apple ID. Xcode will automatically create a local development certificate for you.
5.  You can now close Xcode.

#### 3. Build the App

From the root of the project directory, run the main `make` command:

```bash
make
```
This command will:
- Build and archive the application.
- Export a clean, runnable `Illumination.app` into a `./build` directory.

You can now run the app from the `./build` folder.
